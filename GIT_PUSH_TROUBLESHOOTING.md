# Git Push Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem: "I made changes but they're not showing on GitHub"

---

## ✅ STEP-BY-STEP SOLUTION

### Step 1: Check if you're on the correct branch

```bash
git branch
```

**Expected output:**
```
  main
* feature/manual-debit     ← The * should be on YOUR branch
```

**If you see `* main`**, switch to your branch:
```bash
git checkout feature/manual-debit
```

---

### Step 2: Check your current status

```bash
git status
```

**If you see:** `nothing to commit, working tree clean`
- This means no changes were made, OR
- You're looking at the wrong folder

**If you see:** `Changes not staged for commit` or `Untracked files`
- You have changes that need to be committed!
- Continue to Step 3

**If you see:** `Your branch is ahead of 'origin/feature/manual-debit' by X commits`
- You have commits that need to be pushed!
- Skip to Step 5

---

### Step 3: Add your changes

```bash
git add .
```

This stages ALL your changes for commit.

---

### Step 4: Commit your changes

```bash
git commit -m "Add Manual Debit module work"
```

Change the message to describe what you did:
- `"Add Manual Debit UI"`
- `"Implement search functionality"`
- `"Connect Manual Debit to API"`

---

### Step 5: Push to GitHub

```bash
git push origin feature/manual-debit
```

**Expected output:**
```
Counting objects: 10, done.
Writing objects: 100% (10/10), 1.5 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
To https://github.com/deGarushiya/PARTS_Treasury.git
   abc1234..def5678  feature/manual-debit -> feature/manual-debit
```

✅ **Success!** Your changes are now on GitHub!

## 🔍 VERIFY YOUR PUSH

1. Go to: https://github.com/deGarushiya/PARTS_Treasury
2. Click the branch dropdown (says "main" by default)
3. Select `feature/manual-debit`
4. You should see YOUR files and changes!

## ⚠️ COMMON ERRORS

### Error: "src refspec feature/manual-debit does not match any"

**Solution:**
```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout feature/manual-debit
git pull origin feature/manual-debit
# Then try adding and committing again
```

---

### Error: "Permission denied"

**Solution:** GitHub requires authentication.

**For HTTPS:**
```bash
# You'll be prompted for username and password
# Password = Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password!)
```

**Ask team lead for Personal Access Token if needed.**

---

### Error: "Your branch is behind"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Pull latest changes first
git pull origin feature/manual-debit

# Then push your changes
git push origin feature/manual-debit
```

---
